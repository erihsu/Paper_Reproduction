the folder mainly contain four kinds of files:

#### **Mosfet parameter model card**

The model card is generated by PTM website(http://ptm.asu.edu/) at 45nm technology node, which includes basic pmos and nmos BSIM4 model.

#### **Clock buffer spice netlist** 

Clock buffer behaves as two serial inverters so it is  contructed with two same inverters. Size of each inverter is designed same as the inverters in  ISPD 2009 competition(http://www.ispd.cc/contests/09/ispd09cts.html) package currently.

#### **Simulation process control** 

To generate target lookup tables (LUTs), we use ngspice as simulator to get simulation data. As our expected,   we want to get three LUTs of buffer at Near-Threshold Voltage (NTV): delay model, transition (output slew) propagation model, power dissiption model. The first two model is different from normal buffer model which works at normal voltage, they are responsible for technology variation characterization. So , the simulation performs 200 times (for simplify) Monte Carlo simulation at 0.55v to get $\mu$ and $\sigma$ of delay and output slew. 

#### **Python scripts for automation**  

To sweep the different input slew and load capacitance combination conditions, we use python script to control input slew and load capacitance in the simulation process and automatically collcet the simulation results from log file after simulation.
