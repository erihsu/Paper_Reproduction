reproduction paper researching in Ultra-low voltage (ULV) clock tree design

# DP+DME



DP+DME algorithm is proposed by Xin Zhao in 2010[1] to optimize clock tree slew and skew at ULV. The reproduction code is located in **DP_DME** folder.


# BufH

In [2], Seok proposed an un-buffered H-tree (or few clock buffer level) method to dramatically reduce clock skew variation at ULV. For impressive purpose , the buffered-Htree with limited buffer stage level is implemented in **H-Tree** folder.
